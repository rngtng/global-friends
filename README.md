# Global Friends

As super simple how to on how to map you global friends on a ..... Map.

let's get started:


## 1. Adjust the Input Form
We're using Google Forms to collect the data. For that, adjust the existing forms title/description/questions to your needs:

## 2. Share the form with your friends
In order to collect the data, send an email/tweet/facebook message to your friends, asking to fill out this form:

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1EF9hyL7wD4pODqnWkXZ-tMu66o5Qi0hSzCNuZJS2_LA/viewform

(same as clicking 'senden' or 'send' button in step 1.)


## 3. Access the input data
Once your friends answered the questions, see the results here in the connected google spreadsheet:

## 4. Map results on a map
Finally, to show the location of your friends on a map, go to https://www.mapcustomizer.com and klick on 'Bulk Entry' on the right side. There, copy column D from the spreadsheet of step 3. Now, all your friends locations should appear on a map


## 5. Save Map
For  future reference, save the map by clicking 'save' next to 'Bulk Entry'. Name it what you want. E.g. I did a test with

https://www.mapcustomizer.com/map/test%20hallot


## 6. Embed the Map into your Website
To embed the map into your website, you need to add an iframe and reference the saved map. See https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rngtng/global-friends/master/index.html for an source example. Apparently 'mapcustomizer' detects the iframe and redirects to the actual page asap a user action is triggered. Maybe other projects besides mapcustomizer offer a better solution here.

An example Website with an iframe including the mapcustomizer map is here: https://rngtng.github.io/global-friends/
